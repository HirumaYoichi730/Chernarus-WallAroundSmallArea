DayZ Chernarus - WallAroundSmallArea.
I had this idea for a Wall around this area when I used to have a base there.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:
1: 1x Land_Castle_Gate.
2: 2x Land_Castle_Bergfrit.
3: 6x Land_Castle_Stairs.
4: 28x Land_Castle_Donjon.
5: 1x Bonfire.
6: 57x StaticObj_Misc_Obstacle_Ramp.
7: 1x Land_Misc_Well_Pump_Blue.
8: 2x StaticObj_Platform1_Stairs_Block.
If you found this on my youtube channel. You might have noticed that number 7 and number 8 are not in the video and also on one
of the towers near the gate there is no ramp. I had added those four objects later.

So, easiest way to find this is if you go the roundabout at Cherno, the one that has the Tank monument at the middle.
And then you just follow the road up towards the apartments complex area and at the intersection go to the right.
Follow that road till you get to the powerstation that should be on your left. And then go to the right till you get to the
small military camp. Take a left turn and follow the road up the hill all the way till you see a pub to the right side of the road.
Next to that building there is a dirt road to the right. follow that and you should see it. However, if you passed the pub.
DonÂ´t worry, you will be able to see the area from the road.
Other way to find it is from Zeleno. Just go towards Drozhino and just keep going through Drozhino and you will get to Kozlovka.
Just keep going past the truckspawn that is outside that big metal barn that is falling apart on the left side.
There is just one entrance, so it easy to defend.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/WallAroundSmallArea.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/WallAroundSmallArea.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
